    <h2 class="c25" id="h.fwwvb84o1pt7"><span>Introduction</span></h2>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6">The recent, publicly documented murders of multiple Black people by the police have laid bare the urgent and mortal threat posed by institutionalized racism and white supremacy to Black lives. Administrators at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and Yale University responded to these events by sending us numerous emails expressing their shock, anger, and fear, and identified these incidents as &quot;reminders of a Yale gone-by.&quot; This characterization is objectively untrue: institutionalized racism at Yale is alive and well, and the current administration is complicit in maintaining it.</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>Ten years ago, Black and brown students and faculty wrote </span><span class="c28"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fg5_4ipKnAye6QmxeXl3J-jc4PpBzFUg/view?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592936420568000">an extensive report</a></span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;demanding immediate curricular reform and creation of a multidisciplinary research center addressing structural determinants of health inequity and injustice. That report, like so many before it, was buried and ignored. Five years later, a group of students called NextYSM stood up at a town hall very similar to this one and delivered </span><span class="c28"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EDefEGQ3KAwrhjgVPDr4nlHuQT3K-sgsgXU7YR9DSlA/edit&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592936420569000">a set of demands</a></span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;to Dean Alpern that outlined concrete steps to address systemic racism at YSM. </span><span class="c28"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k0Xx4YeqJdRVHjSMJ0SejfXHYUgVgkQL/view?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592936420569000">Another detailed report</a></span><span>&nbsp;in 2018</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;formally outlined very similar priorities. It is now 2020. After 10 years of endless meetings and committees, considerable effort from students, faculty, and the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, Community Engagement, and Equity (DICE), little has changed. Our curriculum remains racist. Our faculty is overwhelmingly white. A private police force employed by this University is empowered to terrorize Black and brown students and to use deadly force against the citizens of New Haven, yet is accountable to neither group. And, of course, Yale commands the resources of a small country in a city which struggles to pay for primary education. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6">Today, we again demand action. We demand a YSM that is anti-racist, a YSM that actively dismantles its own complicity in systemic and structural violence against Black people. We acknowledge that racism does not act within a vacuum, but rather is enmeshed with other systems of oppression that must be dismantled together. Although many of our concerns extend beyond the School of Medicine&ndash;&ndash;to Yale University or to Yale-New Haven Health system (YNHHS)&ndash;&ndash;these bureaucratic entanglements are no excuse for inaction. We expect that our Deans will actively work to ensure fulfillment of these demands across these artificial boundaries, just as they did for the response to COVID-19. The actions we demand are not radical. They are the bare minimum essential steps toward rectifying the inequities and harm perpetuated by this institution. They are not negotiable.</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>We have 9 core demands, each with a detailed list of actionable items. </span><span>All unmet items from the original 2015 NextYSM demands are included in these significantly expanded demands.</span>

    <h2 class="c25" id="h.tgdynni8uvp4"><span class="c26 c9">2. We demand curricular reform that is anti-oppressive and anti-racist. </span></h2>
    <h4 class="c39 c35" id="h.ophw0tek73ra"><span>Implicit bias training is ineffective and inadequate; racism and oppression are drivers of disease and are ubiquitous in healthcare, and nothing short of a comprehensive, anti-oppressive curriculum does justice to students or our patients.</span></h4>
    <p class="c12"><span>An </span><span class="c9">anti-oppressive curriculum is meant not only to make students aware of inequity but to teach them to actively resist systems of oppression</span><span>. We have great confidence in the Health Equity thread leader, Dr. Beverly </span><span>Sheares</span><span class="c6">, to enact such a curriculum; however, we want to ensure she has the resources and the clear mandate to do so. To emphasize the scope of the task before her, we briefly outline our vision for an anti-oppressive curriculum.</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>Two core parts of such a curriculum are </span><span class="c9">structural competency</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c9">anti-racist pedagogy</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Structural competency is the ability to recognize and articulate how structural forces&mdash;laws, policies, companies, economies, the built environment&mdash;affect health, and to imagine and observe structural interventions.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Anti-racist pedagogy is a method whereby students learn to critically reflect on oppressive power relationships; by examining issues from multiple perspectives and confronting&mdash;often emotionally&mdash;their own biases, students can work to overcome them.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;We highlight anti-racism here but this methodology can be applied to resist other systems of oppression. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>Transforming our current curriculum into an anti-oppressive curriculum will require both addition and subtraction. First, a large number of ahistorical and non-scientific ideas need to be removed. Race is a social construct, not a biological one</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>. Nevertheless, decades of research have eagerly sought to tie differences in racial outcome to genetics&mdash;often in the face of compelling evidence otherwise. The idea of biological race is embedded so deeply in the medical literature and in the thinking of many clinicians that it almost always passes without comment.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In this sense, a massive effort will be needed to &ldquo;debiologize&rdquo; race in our </span><span>curriculum</span><span>. The use of race in diagnostic testing (e.g., estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate), treatment algorithms (e.g. hypertension guidelines), and risk assessment (e.g. pooled cohort equations for ASCVD risk) must be critically evaluated. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6">Likewise, sex and gender must be carefully disentangled; the prevalence, risk factors, and presenting symptoms differ in complex ways with both sex (due to biological differences) and gender (due to cultural and structural factors). Teachings which characterize male anatomy, disease presentation, or behaviors as &ldquo;typical&rdquo; or &ldquo;default&rdquo; must be revised. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6">Finally, there are numerous instances where frank bias, inappropriate and non-inclusive comments, cultural appropriation, or historical inaccuracy persist in the curriculum&mdash;often despite annual complaints from students about the same problematic issues. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6">Many things must also be added&mdash;too much to list here, but here is a partial list: </span></p>
    <ul class="c11 lst-kix_uj7zvlv5zzlk-0 start">
        <li class="c12 c16"><span class="c6 c17">Teach clinical presentations of diseases across diverse patient populations. </span></li>

        <li class="c8"><span class="c6 c17">Show skin pathologies on all skin types, show the &lsquo;red reflex&rsquo; in Black and brown patients, etc. </span></li>
        <li class="c8"><span class="c17">Use precise language when talking about sex and gender. Avoid narrow illness scripts that cast the clinical presentation of disease in men or males as typical, while making women or females seem atypical. When discussing clinical differences in sex or gender, whenever possible attribute those differences to the mechanism from which they are understood to arise: disparate anatomy, endocrine differences, social factors, or others. If the mechanism is not known, simply state as much.</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;Recognize that biological sex is distinct from social gender, and that neither are binary categories. </span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="c11 lst-kix_uj7zvlv5zzlk-0">
        <li class="c12 c16"><span class="c6 c17">Provide historical context in places where the medical literature is deeply entwined with ancestry&mdash;for example, the increased prevalence of genetic diseases among Ashkenazi Jewish people. </span></li>
        <li class="c12 c16"><span class="c6 c17">Discuss the roles of underrepresented physicians, scientists, and activists&mdash;traditionally excluded in accounts of the history of medicine and public health. For example: </span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="c11 lst-kix_uj7zvlv5zzlk-1 start">

    <h3 class="c24" id="h.ms5i0dyf4q7d"><span class="c19 c9">Systems and culture in the institutional environment</span></h3>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c9">An inclusive institutional environment is not rooted solely in individual behavior, but also in systems</span><span>&nbsp;(rules, procedures, leadership structures) </span><span class="c9">and culture</span><span>&nbsp;(values, beliefs, behavioral norms).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Interventions that purely focus on individual behaviors (such as implicit bias trainings or punitive measures against individual behavior episodes) are ineffective at changing the composition and culture of an organization.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This is because institutional context (systems and culture) can be so powerful as to override any individual&rsquo;s personal inclinations.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Further, and even if individual actions are changed, without change to systems, those systems will re-create the same problematic culture.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;The bulk of our demands are therefore intended to address structural and cultural factors. We call attention to several specific systems to show how they perpetuate a non-inclusive culture: </span></p>
    <ul class="c11 lst-kix_w76k8a4bmrpa-0 start">
        <li class="c12 c16"><span class="c9">Faculty tenure and promotion processes</span><span>: promotion and tenure committees reward certain types of academic products (namely publications and grants), while the burden of other types of institutional labor (mentorship, committee service, diversity and inclusion efforts) falls disproportionately on faculty from groups who are already underrepresented in medicine&mdash;BIPOC and women in particular. While leadership claims that this work is valued in the promotion process, it is clear that this is not the case&mdash;both from numerous conversations with faculty and from the demographic makeup of faculty at each level of the academic ladder. Despite increased scientific innovation in those from underrepresented groups, they are less likely to achieve recognition and measures of career success than those from majority groups.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;Moreover, the opacity of the promotion process prevents this process from being studied. Ultimately, this discrepancy in valuation prevents these faculty from achieving higher academic rank (associated with increased compensation, job security, and standing in the academic community) and causes more of them to leave academic medicine. The effect is an explicit signal that certain types of faculty (and the labor they provide) is not of value to the institution. </span></li>
        <li class="c12 c16"><span class="c9">Faculty compensation structure</span><span>: Most faculty are assigned a salary based on department, academic rank, and leadership/administrative responsibilities. The Dean&rsquo;s Office provides a certain amount of support for that salary (typically 50% support for junior faculty and 30% support for tenured faculty)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;then faculty must undertake revenue-generating activities to fund the remainder of that salary&mdash;including obtaining competitive external funding and performing clinical activities. Mentorship (with limited exceptions), teaching, and advocacy are typically not such funded activities; neither is service on relevant committees, task forces, etc. Dean Alpern has assured us that faculty are &ldquo;compensated for teaching,&rdquo; in the sense that if a faculty member spends 20% of their time teaching, then the cost of that faculty member&rsquo;s teaching is 20% of that faculty member&rsquo;s salary&mdash;presumably coming from the percent support guaranteed by the Dean&rsquo;s Office. </span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c12 c29"><span>This model has several flaws. First, faculty are explicitly rewarded for increasing their revenue-generating activity; for example, grant funding allows a faculty member to recruit research trainees, increasing their research output; clinical collections or salary support for administrative duties can offset money that would otherwise support faculty salary, having the same effect. The same is not true for teaching, which is typically not compensated at all. Second, as above, activities such as teaching and mentorship are valued significantly less in promotion and tenure committees than revenue-generating activities. Third, this model fails to acknowledge that certain uncompensated activities fall more heavily on particular faculty members, as discussed above. Perhaps most importantly, this model ignores the fact there are major disparities in grant funding success rates by race and ethnicity</span><sup><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c6">&mdash;quite likely due to a constellation of structural and cultural factors that affect the peer review process and funding agencies&mdash;so treating assuming these outcomes are indicative of merit will likely recapitulate inequities. </span></p>
    <ul class="c11 lst-kix_w76k8a4bmrpa-0">
        <li class="c12 c16"><span class="c9">Departmental funds flow</span><span>: Presently, most of the roughly $1 billion of clinical revenue</span><sup><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;at YSM is distributed to departments; ~10% of this amount is collected by the Dean&rsquo;s Office to underwrite indirect costs of research, fund the Office of Education, and build reserves (among other items). Department chairs use their revenue &ldquo;cross-subsidize&rdquo; faculty who are engaged in teaching or research. This model impairs the ability of both the departments and the Dean&rsquo;s Office to direct funding towards institutional priorities. It creates strong incentives for departments to pursue revenue-generating activities; departments which perform procedures collect disproportionately more clinical revenue, and thus are better funded. This also creates institutional inefficiencies&mdash;the Department of Neurosurgery can staff more rooms per clinician than the Section of Rheumatology; the latter is doubly-punished, as its clinical collections are dependent on outpatient visits (rather than procedures), but it has less money to run its clinical practice efficiently. Given that procedural specialties tend to be less diverse, these differences in burden (and compensation) also break along racial and gender lines. Again, this signals the valuation of certain types of labor over others. &nbsp;</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="c24" id="h.phcyh0f4grpe"><span class="c19 c9">Responses to individual behavior</span></h3>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6">In addition to changes to the structures and systems of YSM, we will need to articulate how we expect individuals to contribute to an inclusive community: </span></p>
    <ul class="c11 lst-kix_i610bkb0mfe4-0 start">
        <li class="c12 c16"><span>We endorse </span><span class="c9">anti-oppression training</span><span>, the goal of which is to </span><span class="c6">develop skills to resist the systems and culture contributing to oppression in our own institution. This includes teaching individuals to examine their own beliefs, prejudices, and biases, as well as the beliefs, values, and norms they inherit from the institution&rsquo;s culture.</span></li>
        <li class="c12 c16"><span>To handle individual instances of bias and harassment, we advocate a process rooted in </span><span class="c9">education and restorative </span><span class="c9">justice</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;Restorative justice seeks to repair harm caused by negative behavior, in a manner that is empowering to the person who suffered that harm. Often this is done by helping the two parties meet and agree on a way to repair the harm&mdash;but of course this may not always be possible or desirable, in which case alternative methods are necessary. Regardless, the person who committed the negative behavior should take responsibility for the harm and commit to change. This process can be transformative and lead to lasting change in behavior.</span></li>
        <li class="c12 c16"><span>Respect for the YSM community can be demonstrated by </span><span class="c9">meaningfully holding accountable the people who commit acts of misconduct</span><span>, including sexual harassment and assault, mistreatment, and bullying. Those who have shown through their actions they do not value the YSM community may no longer find themselves to be a part of it. There is a pervasive view at YSM that those who commit gross acts of misconduct, in violation of the intentional community we have created, face no consequences&mdash;or are even commended.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Even if this view is inaccurate, it contributes to widespread fear of reporting misconduct: students</span><sup><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and faculty</span><sup><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;fear retribution, do not feel confidentiality is assured, and they have little reason to believe their complaints will be addressed. We can and must rescind the damaging message that misconduct is not taken seriously, and thereby make it easier for students and faculty to report misconduct without fear of retribution. We can instead create a system in which we are all valued.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c12"><span>Crucially, these </span><span class="c9">processes for dealing with individual behavior need to be equipped to identify patterns</span><span>&mdash;either within a single person or across the institution&mdash;in order to inform the development of better policies and other institutional responses. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c24" id="h.6rguiqcphpt3"><span class="c9 c19">Comments on the Creation of a Title VI Office</span></h3>
    <p class="c12"><span>Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects against discrimination on the basis of race or national origin in programs or institutions receiving federal funds.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In May of 2018, </span><span class="c20"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/10/12/150140/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592936420602000">following a racist incident</a></span><span>, Black graduate students</span><span>&nbsp;and their allies wrote an open letter (</span><span class="c20"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.conversationx.com/2018/05/26/an-open-letter-to-the-yale-administration-from-black-graduate-students-and-allies/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592936420603000">An Open Letter to the Yale Administration from Black Graduate Students and Allies</a></span><span>)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;recommending the establishment of a Title VI office at Yale, among several other important changes. Similar to the better-known Title IX office, a Title VI office would investigate and respond to race-based discrimination. Nominally, the Office for Equal Opportunity Programs was at that time responsible for such actions. President Salovey&rsquo;s </span><span class="c20"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://president.yale.edu/speeches-writings/statements/strengthening-yale-s-community-learning&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592936420603000">response</a></span><span>&nbsp;created a Student Advisory Group on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and otherwise focused on additional training on available University resources and implicit bias, as well as a forthcoming review by external experts. Before this report arrived, the University ruled out the creation of a separate Title VI office, to the frustration of many students.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>That report,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;when it arrived, identified several key problems with the University&rsquo;s Title VI enforcement structure: it remained unclear to students where to go to raise Title VI concerns; University communications and responses to racist incidents were inadequate; the Office for Equal Opportunity Programs lacked capabilities for tracking the development of proceedings; and additional proactive training was needed for students, faculty, and staff. In President Salovey&rsquo;s response to the report,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>he agreed</span><span>&nbsp;to clarify leadership structures, add staff to the Office for Equal Opportunity Programs, and rename that office, which is now called the </span><span class="c20"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://oiea.yale.edu/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592936420604000">Office of Institutional Equity and Access</a></span><span>&nbsp;(OIEA)</span><span class="c6">. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>However, despite all of this action, it is not apparent to us how much has changed. </span><span>It is unclear whether more staff have been added to OIEA. Several problems identified throughout this process apparently remain unaddressed&mdash;the OIEA remains opaque and difficult to find, although a new, separate website</span><sup><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;was created to direct students either to the OIEA or the Title IX Office. The only method listed to file a formal complaint with the OIEA (which does not mention Title VI on its website) is to contact the Senior Director, Valerie Stanley.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;There is no formal complaint resolution process described. It remains unclear how many instances of race-based discrimination and harrassment have occurred, because there is evidently no public reporting process (short of student complaints reaching the popular press). And, of course, there remain major problems with the way the University communicates responses to major crises.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The President&rsquo;s Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging continues its work,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;although students are relegated to a separate Advisory Group</span><sup><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and report &ldquo;frustration&rdquo; that this group &ldquo;was not being taken seriously.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Overall, the impression of this process is frustratingly familiar to many students: students demand change in the form of simple, clearly articulated reforms; they are met with multiple committees, reports, revisions to names of offices and titles, and very little sense that much has changed. This response is so well recognized it has a commonly used name: &ldquo;the Yale &lsquo;no.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>Finally, the University&rsquo;s reforms are inadequate for a very simple reason: the massive disparity in resources for Title IX compared to Title VI is itself inequitable, unjust, and unacceptable. </span><span>Today, we re-focus on and amplify the </span><span class="c20"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.conversationx.com/2018/05/26/an-open-letter-to-the-yale-administration-from-black-graduate-students-and-allies/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592936420606000">moral clarity in the message of our allies over two years ago</a></span><span>&mdash;Create a Title VI Office.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    </ol>
    <p class="c12 c29"><span class="c6 c17">We specifically oppose isolated unconscious bias training (also known as implicit bias training) for several reasons:</span></p>
    <ol class="c11 lst-kix_ty0wt5jlkx0x-1" start="8">
        <li class="c8"><span class="c17">Implicit bias training focuses on individual bias, rather than systemic or institutional factors. This focus &ldquo;emphasizes agency (eg, individual choice) over structure (eg, institutional, organisational, and political systems), ignoring the latter&rsquo;s role in framing not only the beliefs and actions of individuals but also the rules, regulations, laws, and culture that govern social institutions.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span class="c6 c17">&nbsp;This has the effect of &ldquo;depoliticizing&rdquo; systemic racism&mdash;that is, encouraging a focus on individual rather than systemic change. </span></li>
        <li class="c8"><span class="c17">Available evidence from large meta-analyses suggests that implicit bias training has a weak effect on implicit measures of bias and a trivial effect on explicit bias or behavior.</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup><span class="c17">&nbsp;Perhaps relatedly, there is considerable controversy about the ability of implicit association tests (IATs) to predict racial and ethnic discrimination.</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c17">&nbsp;This finding is consistent with broader studies of diversity programs and prejudice reduction strategies, which have revealed that ongoing, integrated, multifaceted approaches are necessary</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup><span class="c6 c17">&mdash;all features which isolated implicit bias training programs lack. </span></li>
        <li class="c8"><span class="c6 c17">By definition, implicit bias training does not address explicit biases and is therefore unlikely to be effective for those already aware of their biases or who lack motivation to change. </span></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="c12 c29"><span class="c17">To be clear, we do not deny the existence of unconscious bias nor object to the use of implicit association testing as a part of an integrated, anti-oppression training program. </span><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <h2 class="c25" id="h.x45jdqno1jnn"><span class="c26 c9">4. We demand increased diversity among the faculty and student body. </span></h2>
    <h4 class="c39 c35" id="h.7uqoqxptf79v"><span class="c36 c33">Beyond recruitment, Yale must develop and retain a diverse faculty; this includes compensating faculty and students for the vast, racialized equity labor that currently falls overwhelmingly to those who identify as Black, Indigenous, or people of color. This burden is especially heavy on women of color. </span></h4>
    <p class="c12"><span>The YSM faculty fails to reflect the diversity of our nation, or even the physician workforce&mdash;a shocking 2.5% of YSM ladder faculty are Black or African American,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt51" id="ftnt_ref51">[51]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;compared to ~6% of physicians and &ge;12% of the general population.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt52" id="ftnt_ref52">[52]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;3% of ladder faculty are Hispanic or Latinx, compared to 5.5% of physicians and &gt;15% of the US population. ~41% of ladder faculty are women,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt53" id="ftnt_ref53">[53]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;but only ~22% of tenured faculty are women. The same is likely true for other domains (e.g. sexual orientation, gender identity), although data are lacking.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c15"><span class="c6"></span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>Faculty diversity is both an inherent good and a prerequisite to a diverse and inclusive community at YSM. Diverse groups make better decisions,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;so it stands to reason a more diverse faculty and leadership would yield a better-run school; diversity in science</span><sup><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and technology</span><sup><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;produces better outcomes; a diverse healthcare workforce provides better care,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt57" id="ftnt_ref57">[57]</a></sup><span>sometimes strikingly so.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt58" id="ftnt_ref58">[58]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Diverse faculty are essential to providing sufficient formal and informal mentorship to a diverse student body.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt59" id="ftnt_ref59">[59]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;Additionally, faculty diversity affects our ability to recruit a diverse student body&mdash;admitted students who decline to matriculate have cited the lack of visibility of diverse faculty as a key reason for declining admission offers. Faculty diversity is one prerequisite (but not sufficient to promote) an inclusive learning environment. Scholarly diversity ensures there are experts available to teach on topics such as health equity and social determinants of health, the science of diversity, and medical humanities. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>A </span><span class="c33">comprehensive</span><span>&nbsp;effort is needed to diversify the faculty at YSM. In addition to centralized reforms and supervision</span><sup><a href="#ftnt60" id="ftnt_ref60">[60]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;of the hiring process throughout the school, perhaps more important are steps to promote and retain diverse faculty. We outline several strategies below. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6">For students, two major challenges are matriculating/admitting diverse students and broadening the &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; of students applying to health professional and graduate school. To this end we propose several steps to reduce bias and increase equity in the admissions process, but we also emphasize support for &ldquo;pipeline programs&rdquo; that aim to expose prospective under-represented students to health professions and to support their eventual application and matriculation. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>Finally, for both students and faculty, we draw attention to the vast, uncompensated labor of advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion at this institution. &ldquo;Racialized equity labor&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt61" id="ftnt_ref61">[61]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;describes the phenomenon whereby underrepresented students and faculty push the institution for diversity, equity, and inclusion; are tapped to implement initiatives (for which they are not compensated&mdash;financially or by career advancement); and ultimately often have their efforts co-opted&mdash;claimed by the institution as its own, but often diluted or changed from the original vision. This process is exhausting, and it is a</span><span>&nbsp;significant structural barrier to the retention, career advancement, and wellness of BIPOC faculty and trainees&mdash;particularly women of color.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;We therefore call on YSM to recognize and compensate this labor, in a variety of ways. </span></p>

    <p class="c12"><span>It is abundantly clear that racism, sexual misconduct, police violence, and other forms of oppression are health issues. However, few interventions proposed to address diversity, equity, and inclusion are well supported by evidence. We have tried to highlight the best available evidence here, but it is clear that there are vast gaps in our understanding&mdash;of how to address bias, sexual misconduct, race-based discrimination; of how we should make our communities more diverse and inclusive; and of how our society should look with a dramatically reduced police force. </span><span>We should approach these pervasive societal problems as we do other problems in medicine&mdash;with rigorous academic research. </span><span class="c9">We propose Yale create a multi-disciplinary research center, which we are calling the Health Justice and Social Innovation Center, as a way to use its considerable strengths to become the national leader on these issues.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Of course, these strengths extend outside the medical school, and such a center should draw upon expertise from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Nursing School, the Law School, and the School of Management.</span></p>

    <h3 class="c24" id="h.5w8745fyu6n1"><span>Yale&rsquo;s Endowment</span></h3>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6 c1">Yale&rsquo;s endowment management strategy&mdash;known as the Yale Model, or simply the Endowment model&mdash;is famous and influential. One notable feature of this model is its reliance on active portfolio management&mdash;purchasing assets at the discretion of fund managers&mdash;as opposed to &ldquo;passive&rdquo; management, for instance in funds that track the total stock market. The majority of the Yale endowment&rsquo;s portfolio consists of &ldquo;non-traditional&rdquo; assets&mdash;hedge funds, private equity, foreign equity, venture capital, real estate, and so on&mdash;as opposed to domestic stocks and bonds. Yale&rsquo;s investment office argues that this strategy is responsible for outstanding returns. However, active management incurs fees to support the fund managers. The endowment is managed in relative secrecy, so the exact cost of these fees is not publicly known, but the fees are estimated to be between $500 million and $1 billion per year. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6 c1">We object to this secretive, costly investment strategy on several grounds:</span></p>
    <ul class="c11 lst-kix_fmpubbry231p-0 start">
        <li class="c12 c16"><span class="c9 c1">We question the claim of outsized returns, which are impossible to meaningfully verify with available data.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Yale reports the absolute returns on its investments on an annual basis and compares those returns with a benchmark, such as an index fund which tracks the performance of the stock market. Over a certain time window, Yale&rsquo;s actively managed endowment outperforms a benchmark composed of index funds. However, several analysts have argued that it does so by assuming considerably greater risk.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt74" id="ftnt_ref74">[74]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;This risk cannot be known precisely, because Yale only reports returns annually&mdash;smoothing over much volatility in its portfolio&rsquo;s performance&mdash;so risk must be estimated by constructing model portfolios that perform similarly to Yale&rsquo;s. Several analysts have constructed passive management strategies which match or out-perform Yale&rsquo;s expensive, actively-managed portfolio by simply assuming greater risk.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt75" id="ftnt_ref75">[75]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;For instance, by borrowing money (&ldquo;leveraging&rdquo;), one can increase returns at the cost of greater risk. </span><span class="c9 c1">The point is not that Yale&rsquo;s returns are not impressive, but that their massive spending on active management may not be justified&mdash;and that the value of Yale&rsquo;s costly active management is impossible to publicly evaluate because risks are hidden. </span><span class="c1"><br><br>Furthermore, Yale&rsquo;s Investments Office confidently asserts that Yale&rsquo;s endowment success will continue long into the future, but the degree of risk assumed and the reliance on illiquid assets calls this into question. For instance, in one study, the only asset class where Yale&rsquo;s active managers </span><span class="c1">outperformed</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the market was in private equity;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt76" id="ftnt_ref76">[76]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">however</span><span class="c1">, the returns from private equity are highly variable compared to the stock market, meaning past performance does not guarantee future performance.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt77" id="ftnt_ref77">[77]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;There is some evidence this is now the case&mdash;as of 2018, Yale&rsquo;s endowment over a 10-year time period no longer outperforms even a simple, non-leveraged, passive investing strategy.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt78" id="ftnt_ref78">[78]</a></sup><span class="c6 c1">&nbsp;It remains to be seen what impact the recession following the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the value of Yale&rsquo;s endowment. </span></li>
        <li class="c12 c16"><span class="c9 c1">Given this lack of transparency, we question the ethics of massive spending on investment management</span><span class="c1">, personally enriching owners of hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds (who are overwhelmingly white and male)</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt79" id="ftnt_ref79">[79]</a></sup><span class="c6 c1">. </span></li>
        <li class="c12 c16"><span class="c9 c1">The lack of transparency facilitates investment in causes which are contrary to Yale&rsquo;s mission.</span><span class="c6 c1">&nbsp;As we discuss below, Yale has refused to divest itself of several high-profile classes of businesses&mdash;including private prisons, fossil fuel companies, and firearm manufacturers. It is impossible to know what other causes are supported by Yale&rsquo;s endowment, because its positions are not published. </span></li>
        <li class="c12 c16"><span class="c9 c1">The lack of transparency and the disposition of the endowment towards private investment raises questions about the relationship between Yale investments and the personal finances of the Board of Trustees</span><span class="c6 c1">&mdash;many of whom have leading roles in financial services companies</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="c24" id="h.6gkkb2tser2u"><span>Yale&rsquo;s wealth, New Haven, and a legacy of slavery and colonialism</span></h3>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6 c1">This massive, costly, and opaque operation to grow Yale&rsquo;s wealth stands in stark contrast to Yale&rsquo;s financial relationship with respect to the City of New Haven. Yale owns a large amount of valuable property in the city (which would otherwise be taxed) and provides many services (e.g. housing, dining, transportation) which might otherwise be provided by businesses (and therefore taxed). As meager consolation for the &gt;$140 billion in tax revenue per year that the city would receive if Yale and YNHHS were taxable entities, the University and hospital make voluntary payments of ~$15 million per year, as well as maintain a portfolio of taxable properties in the city. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c6 c1">Finally, all of this must be considered in the context of this institution&rsquo;s broader history. Yale has historically profited from, and continues to profit from, a legacy of slavery and colonialism. Elihu Yale, the institution&rsquo;s namesake, was a slave trader. University buildings sit atop land taken by force from Algonquin-speaking nations. </span></p>

    <p class="c12"><span>These demands outline our vision for an inclusive, equitable YSM. Achieving this vision will require substantial institutional investment. The first step is a formal commitment to these principles in the School&rsquo;s Mission Statement. Second, and in parallel, is a detailed strategic plan, including measurable goals and a timeline for implementation. Without such a plan, work will continue to be ad hoc, efforts duplicated, labor wasted, and overall progress halting. Managing the complex task of implementing these goals must not fall to students. However, meaningful student participation in all aspects of this work will be essential. Most significantly, selection of major institutional leaders should always involve students as full participants in the process. To this end, we applaud Dean Brown&rsquo;s commitment to include multiple students in the committee to identify the next Deputy Dean for Education. We look forward to a similar commitment in the future. </span></p>

The medical community has done significant harm in perpetuating these violent systems, both through inaction and willful participation. If YSM truly stands by its mission, it needs to create the intellectual, social, and institutional environment to foster diverse leadership and strong communities to meet the complex challenges facing both the field of medicine and humanity as a whole. </span></p>

This would not only alleviate the significant costs to career advancement of identity-based institutional labor, but would provide increased support for all faculty. The cost of hiring a full-time lab technician to support research activities is often too expensive, especially for junior faculty. Additionally, labs often need technician support on a sporadic rather than permanent basis. The ability to access lab technician services on an as-needed basis would significantly enhance research productivity and wellness for both trainees and faculty. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
